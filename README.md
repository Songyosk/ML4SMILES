"Automatic Prediction of Molecular Properties Using Substructure Vector Embeddings within a Feature Selection Workflow" 

By S. G. Jung, G. Jung & J. M. Cole



## Introduction

The description of each file is summarized below:

*(i) smile_descriptors.py*

Script to generate descriptor features based on SMILES of chemical molecules & solvents. 

*(ii) feature_analyses.py*

Script to perform statistical feature analyses

*(iii) feature_engineering.py*

Script to perform feature engineering. By default, a brute-force method is used.

*(iv) GBFS.py*

Script to perform gradient boosted feature selection, generate feature ranking, and carry out recursive feature selection. See "Gradient Boosted and Statistical Feature Selection" in [https://github.com/Songyosk/GBSFS4MPP](https://github.com/Songyosk/GBFS4MPPML).

*(v) Multicollinearity_reduction.py*

Script to perform multicollinearity reduction, which includes correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. Correlation and linkage thresholds are defined to elminate features. 

*(vi) permutation_importance.py*

Script to analyze and identify features that are importance when permutation is performed

*(vii) recursive_feature_elimination.py*

Script to perform recursive feature elimination 

*(viii) optimization.py*

Script to perform Bayesian optimization, which determines the architecture of the predictive model based on a defined hyperparameter space.  

*(ix) utilities.py and read_json.py*

Scripts containing helper functions
